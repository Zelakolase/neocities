        <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
        <p>
            I have been coding since I was 6 years old. I was fascinated with Software Development since it allowed me to do whatever I want. My moral system was developing with time.<br><br> Fast forward to 2018, my grandma just kicked me out of the
            house 'She was abusing me'. I have plenty of time to focus on myself and my career. Since then, I had a societal shock. I had a (now ex-)girlfriend in 2019. I was developing exponentially fast, the amount of information being fed to my mind
            was so high I almost did not comprehend all of it, due to the societal shock.<br><br> As of now, I have <i>nearly</i> fully developed my beliefs. I work and study to benefit humanity as a whole, and to ensure a good future for my kids (if
            I ever got married).

        <p><strong>The Objective</strong></p>
        <p>
            The objective of this website is to share my own journey, and to propagate critical thinking skills. It is a one step closer to a society with no inflammation. Also, I would like to dump all my technical knowledge here, I have known a lot of stuff I want
            to share here. This website acts like a blog, an archive, and a portfolio for any future employer who wants to know Morad as a <i>person</i>, not as an employee.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Current Profession and Interests</strong></p>
        <p>
            I profess in Computer Science, Marcoeconomics, and Pure Mathematics (especially Number Theory). I like to play chess in my (almost nonexistant) free time. I read a lot about the history of sciences and how to take lessons from history in order to make
            more accurate decisions in our lifetime. I am really interested in Game theory and strategic planning, since it allows me to make rational decisions based on a scientific basis.
